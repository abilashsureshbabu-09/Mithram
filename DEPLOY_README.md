# Deployment Instructions

1.  **Deployment Complete (gh-pages branch)**: I have manually deployed your application to the `gh-pages` branch.
2.  **Activate in Settings**:
    *   Go to your GitHub Repository -> **Settings** -> **Pages**.
    *   Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
    *   Under **Branch**, select **gh-pages** and ensure the folder is **/(root)**.
    *   Click **Save**.
3.  **Wait**: It usually takes 1-2 minutes for the site to update.
4.  **Visit**: https://abilashsureshbabu-09.github.io/Mithram/

*Note: You are seeing the README because GitHub was trying to display the "main" branch (source code) instead of the "gh-pages" branch (website).*
